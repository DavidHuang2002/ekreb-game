This game was created for the programming challenge of Change Plus Plus club. It is a scrambled word guessing game where the user tries to guess a word by looking at its scrambled letters.

## Design of the game

The game is organized with sessions. Every time a game starts, the backend creates a new session, which allows multiple players to play at the same time and allows one to continue playing his game as long as one remembers his gameâ€™s URL with the session id. 

The front-end is built using ReactJs + dva.js for state management. 

The back-end is built using NodeJs. The front-end and back-end communicate with each other using RESTful API. 

## How to run the program
