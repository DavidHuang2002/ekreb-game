## How to run the program

### front end
first enter the front end directory
`cd ekreb-frontend`

then install dependencies
`npm install`

then start the front end with
`npm run start`


### back end
first enter the back end directory
`cd ekreb-backend`

then install dependencies
`npm install`

then start the back end with
`node server.js`


### environmental information
here are some information about my computer's environment in case anything goes wrong with running the program
```
node --version
v20.1.0

npm --version
9.6.4
```

## Reflection
I will start with the good aspect. I think one right decision I made was organizing the game with sessions. Every time a game starts, the backend creates a new session, which allows multiple players to play at the same time and allows one to continue playing his game as long as one remembers his gameâ€™s URL with the session id. 
On the other hand, I think the readability can certainly be improved. Due to bad midterms and time management, I ran out of time near the end, and I was in a rush to get functionality done.

## Additional Note about tech stack:
For the front end, I used React + DvaJs, which is a framework that is somewhat outdated and was not well known in the U.S. It was once popular in China, and I used it for my last internship, so I was familiar with it and chose it because of the time constraint.

English Documentation of it might be hard to find, so here I include some links:

## If I have time
- I notice that sometimes there can be a lot of words with the same letters and can be annoying to guess those. If I had more time I wish I can fix this part
- a pop up showing tutorial when user first start game
- I also left some TODO comments in the code for future improvements on implementations
